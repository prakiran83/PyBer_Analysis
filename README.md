# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
PyBer is a ride-sharing app company which has tasked us to create a compeling visualization of its data for the CEO. For this analysis, we are using our python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by the type of cities; i.e urban, suburban, and rural. We will be creating a multiple-line graph that will help us visualize the total weekly fares for each type of city. 

## Result

According to the summary DataFrame above, which inlcues the data for total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type, we can see that there is a difference in ride-sharing data amongst the cities. As we can witness in the picture above, although Rural areas have less rides, compared with Suburban and urban areas, their average fare per ride and average fare per driver is highest. This tells us that the customers in these areas are paying more, per ride, than the areas that is immensly populated. The reason for this can be creadited to the fact that Rrural areas have less drivers and the service demand is high.

This line chart, which covers a 5 month period, shows us that all 3 city types have some fluctuation in their chart. But, we can also see that February is a month that all 3 different city types tend to follow the same pattern. If we look at the graph, we can see that all 3 cities tend to upward curve, kind of, in the begining of the month and a shrap dip at the end of the month.
also, one of the very distinguish difference among these cities is that at the end of April, where urban and rural seem to decline, suburban seesa  sharp increase.

## Summary
### Recommendations based on the results:
1. Urban cities have more drivers than the ride, which can mean that most drivers are not generating mmuch revenue. We need to cut the number of drivers so that the the average goes up.
2. Employ more drivers in rural and suburban cities so that demand is balanced by the supply of service.
3. April seems to be the month that generates more revenue in suburban cities, we need to investigate and find out if this condition can be exploited to generate more revenue.
